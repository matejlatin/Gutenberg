# Gutenberg: A Meaningful Web Typography Starter Kit

[Gutenberg](http://matejlatin.github.io/Gutenberg/) is a flexible and simple-to-use web typography starter kit for web designers and developers. It’s a small step towards a better typography on the web. Beautiful typographic styles can be made by setting base type size, line-height (leading) and measure (max-width).

Gutenberg sets the baseline grid to establish a proper vertical rhythm and makes sure all elements fit into it. It sets up the macro typography so you can focus on the micro-typographic details.

## Installation

Gutenberg is built with Sass and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). Fork or download the repository to get started.

```npm install gutenberg-web-type```


## Why Gutenberg?

Johannes Gutenberg invented a printing press with movable type more than 500 years ago. His invention led to improved readability of books and enabled a distribution on a large scale. His invention improved a medium and took it to another level. This web typography starter kit aims to do exactly the same for another medium — the web.
